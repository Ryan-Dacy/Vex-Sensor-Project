## Light Sensor Demonstration

This video demonstrates the light sensor successfully detecting white lines on the field. The robot is programmed to reverse as soon as a white line is detected. To improve accuracy, we extended the phototransistor off the breadboard using two long wires, allowing it to rest directly on the ground while remaining connected to the circuit.

We mounted the phototransistor just inside the robotâ€™s intake, so when a specific point of the intake contacts the sensor, it detects the white line and triggers the reverse action. Although this is a simple test setup, it effectively demonstrates how the sensor could be integrated into a real competition scenario.

The code used for this demonstration is available in the **VexReceive** folder, and the program is called **DrivingTest**.
